## Usage

### Using with default Props

To integrate the `StarRating` component into your application with the default props (see props table), follow this simple example:

    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

| --------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `maxRating`     | `number`   | `5`       | Maximum number of stars.                       |
| `color`         | `string`   | `#fcc419` | Star color.                                    |
| `size`          | `number`   | `24`      | Size of the stars.                             |
| `defaultRating` | `number`   | `0`       | Preselected rating.                            |
| `onSetRating`   | `function` |           | Callback function invoked when rating changes. |

### Customize the StarRating component using its props

You can customise the component as you wish using one or more of its props, as in the following example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { StarRating } from './components/StarRating';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <StarRating
        maxRating={10}
        color="red"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### `onSetRating` a special props

onSetRating is a callback function invoked the value of the rating. You can use this props for using this value outside the component, as in the following example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { StarRating } from './components/StarRating';

function App() {
  const [userRating, setUserRating] = useState<number>(0);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <StarRating onsetRating={setUserRating} />
      <p>User rating: {userRating}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
